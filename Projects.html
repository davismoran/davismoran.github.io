        <p>Projects I have done both in class and on the side are as follows. I have built a database connected
        to Spotify API where I could search and sort through songs and artists based on different criteria.
        I built a grading tool for my fraternities scholarship chair which allowed him to make grade checks for over
        200 people at high speed. I have all my personal projets for this class listed on my github. These are only a
        few of the highlights however.</p>
